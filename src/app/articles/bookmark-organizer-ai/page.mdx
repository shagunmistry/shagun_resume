I hate organizing files, especially the ones that pile up in my Downloads folder. It's like a digital junkyard that keeps growing, making it impossible to find anything when I need it. But what if I could automate this process using AI?

In this tutorial, we'll build a smart file organizer that uses Anthropic's Claude AI to automatically categorize and organize your files. Let's turn that messy Downloads folder into a well-organized directory structure!

You are not limited to using Anthropic's Claude AI. You can use any AI model that can classify files based on their content.

## The Problem

Manual organization is time-consuming and often inconsistent. What if we could automate this process using AI?

## The Solution

We'll create a Python script that:

1. Scans a directory of your choice
2. Uses Claude AI to intelligently categorize each file
3. Organizes files into appropriate folders based on their content
4. Handles duplicates and maintains a clean structure

## Prerequisites

Before we dive in, you'll need:

- Python 3.7+
- An Anthropic API key (you can get one from [Anthropic's website](https://www.anthropic.com))
- The following Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install anthropic pathlib
  ```

## The Code Breakdown

Let's look at the key components of our file organizer:

### 1. Setting Up the Organizer

```python
class ClaudeFileOrganizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api_key = self._get_api_key()
        self.source_dir = self._get_directory()
        self.organized_dir = self.source_dir / "organized"
        self.client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=self.api_key)
```

This initializes our organizer with:

- User's API key (securely input)
- Source directory to organize
- Output directory for organized files
- Anthropic client for AI classification

### 2. File Classification with Claude

The magic happens in the `classify_file` method:

```python
def classify_file(self, file_info: Dict) -> str:
    prompt = f"""
    You are a productivity guru! 🧠📚🚀
    Based on the following file information, suggest a single appropriate category:
    Filename: {file_info['name']}
    Type: {file_info['mime_type']}
    Created: {file_info['created']}
    """

    message = self.client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
        max_tokens=1024,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )

    category = message.content[0].text.strip().lower()
    return category
```

This method:

1. Takes file metadata as input
2. Constructs a prompt for Claude
3. Gets an AI-powered category suggestion
4. Returns a standardized category name

### 3. The Organization Process

The main organization logic happens in `organize_files`:

- Scans the source directory
- Processes each file
- Creates category folders
- Handles duplicate files
- Moves files to their new homes

```python
# Create category directory
category_dir = self.organized_dir / category
category_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

# Handle duplicates with timestamps
if new_path.exists():
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
    new_path = category_dir / f"{file_path.stem}_{timestamp}{file_path.suffix}"

shutil.move(str(file_path), str(new_path))
```

## Smart Features

1. **Rate Limiting**: The script includes a 5-second delay between API calls to avoid rate limits:

   ```python
   time.sleep(5)  # Prevent API rate limiting
   ```

2. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates keep you informed:

   ```python
   print(f"\rProgress: {processed_files}/{total_files} files processed", end="")
   ```

3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures the script doesn't crash on issues:

   ```python
   try:
       # Process file
   except Exception as e:
       self.logger.error(f"Error processing file {file_path}: {str(e)}")
       continue
   ```

4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging helps track operations and debug issues:
   ```python
   logging.basicConfig(
       level=logging.INFO,
       format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
       handlers=[
           logging.FileHandler('file_organizer.log'),
           logging.StreamHandler()
       ]
   )
   ```

## How to Use It

1. Save the script as `file_organizer.py`
2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install anthropic pathlib
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python file_organizer.py
   ```

4. Enter your Anthropic API key when prompted
5. Provide the directory path you want to organize
6. Watch as your files get automatically organized!

## The Results

Your files will be organized into these categories:

- 📄 documents
- 🖼️ images
- 🎵 audio
- 🎥 video
- 📦 archives
- 💻 code
- 📊 data
- ⬇️ downloads
- 📁 other

Each category gets its own folder, making it easy to find what you need.

## Future Improvements

Here are some ways you could enhance the script:

1. Add custom category definitions
2. Implement file content analysis for better classification
3. Add a preview mode to see changes before applying them
4. Add support for recursive directory organization
5. Create a GUI interface
