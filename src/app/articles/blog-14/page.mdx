# What is Feature Engineering in Machine Learning?

Today, we will talk about **feature engineering**, a crucial skill for anyone working with machine learning models. 

**What is feature engineering?**  Think of it as transforming your raw data into a format that's more meaningful and helpful for your machine learning models. 

Imagine trying to predict house prices using only the number of bedrooms. That's a decent start, but we can do so much better!

**Here's where feature engineering shines:**

* **Derive new features:** Instead of just using the number of bedrooms, we could calculate the **area per bedroom** to understand space efficiency.  
* **Combine features:** We could create a new feature like **"luxury score"** by combining factors like pool size, garage capacity, and high-end appliances.
* **Handle categorical data:**  Turn text-based features like "location" into numerical features by using techniques like one-hot encoding.
* **Clean and preprocess data:**  Remove missing values, handle outliers, and normalize data for better model performance.

**Let's see a quick code example:**

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'Bedrooms': [2, 3, 4, 5],
        'Area': [1000, 1500, 2000, 2500],
        'Price': [200000, 300000, 400000, 500000]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create a new feature: Area per bedroom
df['AreaPerBedroom'] = df['Area'] / df['Bedrooms']

print(df) 
```

**Output:**

```
   Bedrooms  Area  Price  AreaPerBedroom
0         2  1000  200000          500.0
1         3  1500  300000          500.0
2         4  2000  400000          500.0
3         5  2500  500000          500.0
```

By creating this new feature, we've given our model a more nuanced understanding of the data, potentially leading to improved predictions. 

**Remember, feature engineering is an iterative process. Experiment with different features, analyze your model's performance, and refine your approach to achieve the best results!**
