# Git Essentials: The commands you'll actually use as a Developer

I've worked as a Software Developer and Engineer for past 9 years. 
Based on my career at over 10 different companies, I've created a list of git commands that are of use in most of the normal day-to-day development:

* **`git status`:** Your trusty guide. Tells you what files have been changed, added, or are untracked. Use it frequently to stay on top of your project's state.
* **`git add .`:** Stages all changes in your current directory, preparing them to be included in the next commit. Remember the dot!
* **`git commit -m "your message here"`:** Saves your changes with a descriptive message. Good commit messages are like breadcrumbs for future you!
* **`git checkout <branch_name>`:** Switches to a different branch. Think of branches like parallel universes for your code.
* **`git checkout -`:** A quick way to jump back to the branch you were on previously. Like a handy "undo" button for branches.
* **`git merge <branch_name>`:**  Combines changes from another branch into your current one.
* **`git pull`:**  Fetches the latest changes from a remote repository and merges them into your current branch. Stay in sync with your team.
* **`git reset --hard`:**  **Caution!** Discards all uncommitted changes in your working directory. Use with care when you need a clean slate.
* **`git stash`:** Temporarily saves your changes without committing them. Useful when you need to switch branches but aren't ready to commit yet.
* **`git stash pop`:**  Reapplies your stashed changes. Bring back those changes when you're ready to work on them again.
* **`git cherry-pick -m 1 <commit_hash>`:** Applies a specific commit from another branch to your current branch. The `-m 1` is crucial when the commit is part of a merge, ensuring you pick the correct change. Use this sparingly to avoid messy history.

**Bonus Tip:** 

* Use `git log` to view the commit history. It's like a time machine for your code!

Master these, and you'll be well on your way to Git mastery!
