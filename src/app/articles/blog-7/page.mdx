# How to write clean and efficient React code?

After nearly a decade of being a Developer, I've learned a thing or two about writing clean and efficient React code.

Here are some best practices to help you level up your React skills based on my experience:

## 1. Keep Components Small and Focused

One of the key principles of React is component-based architecture. This means breaking your UI into smaller, reusable pieces. Each component should have a single, well-defined purpose.

**Example:**

Instead of having a single "ProductCard" component handling everything, consider splitting it into:

- `ProductCard`: Handles the overall structure and styling.
- `ProductImage`: Renders the product image.
- `ProductName`: Displays the product name.
- `ProductPrice`: Shows the product price.

This makes the code more modular, easier to test, and allows for easier reuse of individual components.

## 2. Leverage Props for Data and Functionality

Components should communicate with each other using props. Pass data and functions down from parent components to child components, keeping data flow predictable and testable.

**Example:**

```javascript
function ProductCard({ product }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <ProductImage src={product.image} />
      <ProductName name={product.name} />
      <ProductPrice price={product.price} />
    </div>
  )
}

// Parent component passing props
;<ProductCard product={productData} />
```

> This is also sometimes called the "**Higher Order Component**" pattern. "**Higher Order Components**" are components that take other components as input and return a new component with additional functionality.

## 3. Use State Management with Context API or Redux

For managing shared data and state, use Context API or Redux. These tools allow you to manage state centrally and keep your components in sync.

**When to use Context API:**

- For simpler state management needs.
- When you have a small to medium-sized application.

**When to use Redux:**

- For complex state management needs.
- When you have a large application with many components.

To learn more about Redux, check out the [official Redux documentation](https://redux.js.org/).
To learn more about Context API, check out the [official React documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext).

**Example:** (Context API)

```javascript
const CartContext = createContext()

function CartProvider({ children }) {
  const [cart, setCart] = useState([])

  const addToCart = (item) => {
    setCart([...cart, item])
  }

  return (
    <CartContext.Provider value={{ cart, addToCart }}>
      {children}
    </CartContext.Provider>
  )
}

// Accessing the context in a child component
function ProductCard({ product }) {
  const { addToCart } = useContext(CartContext)

  // ...
}
```

## 4. Optimize for Performance

React is known for its performance, but there are ways to further improve it:

- **Use `React.memo`:** Prevents re-rendering of components when their props haven't changed.
- **Optimize `useEffect` dependencies:** Only run effects when necessary to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Use `useCallback` and `useMemo`:** Memoize expensive calculations or functions to avoid repetitive computation.

**React Memo Example:**

```javascript
const ProductList = React.memo(({ products }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {products.map((product) => (
        <ProductCard key={product.id} product={product} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
})
```

**UseEffect Dependencies Example:**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchData()
}, [fetchData]) // Only run effect when fetchData changes
```

**UseCallback and UseMemo Example:**

```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b])

const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(a, b)
}, [a, b])
```
> **Note:** Always measure performance improvements with tools like React DevTools or Chrome DevTools to ensure your optimizations are effective.

## 5. Follow a Consistent Coding Style

Use a code linter like ESLint with a style guide like Airbnb or Prettier to ensure your code is consistent, readable, and maintainable.

**Bonus Tip:** Use a code formatter like Prettier to automatically format your code according to your chosen style guide!

To learn more about ESLint, check out the [official ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/).
To learn more about Prettier, check out the [official Prettier documentation](https://prettier.io/).
