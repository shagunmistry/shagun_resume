I built this app that helps me organize my files using AI. It categorizes files into different folders based on their type, making it easier to find and manage them. The app is privacy-focused and never reads the contents of your files. You can choose from different AI providers to power the categorization process.
## Features

- 🤖 AI-powered file categorization
- 🔒 Privacy-focused: analyzes only file names and metadata, never file contents
- ⏸️ Pause and resume organization anytime
- 📊 Real-time progress tracking
- 💫 Support for multiple AI providers (Claude, GPT-4, or Llama)

## Folder Structure

The app creates an "organized" folder in your selected directory with the following structure:

```
📁 organized/
   ├── 📁 documents/  (PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets, etc.)
   ├── 📁 images/     (photos, illustrations, screenshots)
   ├── 📁 audio/      (music, voice recordings, sound effects)
   ├── 📁 video/      (movies, clips, screen recordings)
   ├── 📁 archives/   (zip, rar, 7z files)
   ├── 📁 code/       (source code, scripts)
   ├── 📁 data/       (databases, CSV files, JSON)
   ├── 📁 downloads/  (browser downloads, installers)
   └── 📁 other/      (unclassified files)
```

## Privacy & Security

- The app only analyzes file names and metadata (type, size, creation date)

## Tips for Best Results
